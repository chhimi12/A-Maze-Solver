# Maze-Solver

##Maze Solver with A* Algorithm
This Python project implements the A* algorithm to solve maze puzzles, finding the shortest path from a given start state to a specified goal state. The script takes maze maps represented as NumPy arrays, where open paths are denoted as 1.0, and obstacles are represented as 0.0. The A* algorithm efficiently explores possible paths using heuristics, aiming to discover the optimal solution.
